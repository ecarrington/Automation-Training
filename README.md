# Automation-Training
Work Training - Ansible and Python Network Automation

### Structure
Each session will have a repository with its own applicable playbooks, scripts, examples, roles, and other automation dependencies. Each folder acts on the inventory file and ansible.cfg file located in the root of this directory. Each folder will also have its own wiki page with useful links and resources, as well as course notes for reference.
