quote variables like "{{ this }}"

Variables must always be quoted!

Strings in YAML only require quotation if the value can be misinterpreted as a different data type, such as an integer


Double quotes let us escape special characters as needed. Your IDE should catch this

my_variable1: "{{ other_variable }}\\backslash\nnewline\ttab\\etc"

my_variable1: "{{ other_variable }}/additional/string/literal"

my_variable1: '{{ other_variable }}\\escaping\\not\\happening\t'

my_variable2: "Even without variables inline, although not required, string literals should always be quoted"

When in doubt, use double quotes!
